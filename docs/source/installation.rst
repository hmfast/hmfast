Installation
============

This document explains how to install the `hmfast` emulators and auxiliary files needed for `hmfast`.


Installation Steps
------------------

`hmfast` requires emulators to perform its calculations. 
Before we begin using the code, we must ensure that these emulators have been downloaded.
The repository has a helper script `install_emulators.sh` which will automatically download all compatible emulator models.
Simply run the following in your command line.

.. code-block:: bash

       bash /path/to/hmfast/tools/install_emulators.sh /path/where/emulators/will/be/installed
